   content: MRI is safe for the vast majority of individuals. 
   Prior to the session, 
   you will complete a screening form to determine if you have any existing conditions that would compromise your safety or comfort during the scan.
   For example, 
   individuals with metallic implants or pacemakers would not be eligible to participate. 
   We also recommend that individuals who are claustrophobic not participate.
   MRI does not involve X-rays and exposure to radiation is not a risk associated with MRI. 
   Moreover, 
   our MRIs do not use contrast (e.
   g.
   , 
   gadolinium) and donâ€™t involve taking any medicine.

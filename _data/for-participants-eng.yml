   content: MRI is safe for the vast majority of individuals. 
            Prior to the session,you will complete a screening form to determine if 
            you have any existing conditions that would compromise your safety or 
            comfort during the scan.For example, individuals with metallic 
            implants or pacemakers would not be eligible to participate. 
            We also recommend that individuals who are claustrophobic not participate.
            MRI does not involve X-rays and exposure to radiation is not a risk associated with MRI. 
            Moreover,our MRIs do not use contrast (e.g., gadolinium) 
            and don’t involve taking any medicine.

   content: A research technician will help you into a comfortable position on a padded scanning table.
           A small device (called a “head coil”) will be fitted over your head. 
           This device will allow us to produce detailed images of the brain. 
           The technician will then slowly move the scanning table into a large, 
           cylindrical tube where the images will be collected.During the scan,
           there will be short periods of loud noise generated by the machine. 
           You will be provided with headphones or ear plugs to reduce the intensity of this noise. 
            We will answer all your questions and communicate with you during the session through an intercom system.

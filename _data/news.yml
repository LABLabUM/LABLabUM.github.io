  content: The problem of population aging is becoming increasingly prominent in the world,
            and the physical and mental health problems of the elderly are easy to be ignored. 
            In order to popularize the knowledge of elderly cognitive health status and cognitive test,
            our lab held a cognitive health popularization activity with the theme of 
            "Pay attention to cognitive health, protect the dignity of life" in the Macao 
            Artificial Intelligence Education Promotion Association, so that elderly people 
            can better understand and understand some cognitive problems that we may face with
            the growth of age. To a certain extent, it can improve the elderly's attention to
            their own cognitive health. <br>
            <br>
            In this activity, we combined with an experimental study conducted by our research 
            group at the present stage to investigate the neural mechanisms and influencing factors
            of cognitive and language function in the elderly, introduced cognitive state detection
            methods such as magnetic resonance and cognitive testing, and tried to explore effective
            means to delay cognitive aging from the perspective of language learning and language training.<br>
            <br>
            The activity was successfully held and achieved good results and feedback.

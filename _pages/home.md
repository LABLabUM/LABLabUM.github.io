### About the Lab

Welcome to visit The Language, Aging, and Bilingualism Lab (LAB Lab)! 

Broadly, our research focuses on age-related differences in cognition and the brain, and how the experience of using multiple languages would modulate these age differences. We use behavioral methods as well as different neuroimaging techniques including functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), Electroencephalogram (EEG), and others. The figure below helps demonstrate the research topics in our lab.

Our lab’s director is Dr. Haoyun ZHANG. Our lab is affiliated with the Centre for Cognitive and Brain Sciences (CCBS, ICI) and the Department of Psychology (PSY, FSS) at the University of Macau.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Older adults typically report increased difficulty with language production. However, behavioral and neural factors that contribute to these age-related changes in language production are not very clear. This study focuses on the contribution of cognitive control to language production. Specifically, how different age groups resolve lexical and semantic competition differently in production (multi-level), both behaviorally and neurally (multi-modal), in monolinguals and bilinguals (multi-language). Moreover, how cognitive control traits and states modulate age-related differences in language production. Results from the current project would help us understand the cognitive and language characteristics of the aging population, which is of high significance as older adults represent the largest growing demographic in the world.</p>

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
              This study aims to establish an effective cognitive assessment platform for older individuals in Macau, accurately assess their cognitive conditions, and explore ways to help them fight against cognitive aging. The research focuses on understanding the cognitive health status of local older adults and investigating the feasibility of cognitive training. It involves localizing cognitive assessment methods and tools, examining cognitive aging characteristics, and establishing norms for cognitive and neural mechanisms in Macau aging population. Additionally, the study explores language comprehension and production in elderly individuals, identifies language aging patterns, and develops cognitive and brain training programs focused on language learning to mitigate cognitive aging issues in Macau and beyond.

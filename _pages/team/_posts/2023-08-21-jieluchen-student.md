research_interests:
- Currently, my research interests are of the cognitive mechanism in multi-language acquisition and learning process, specifically with the interaction between ageing and language learning among adults and elders, who are facing challenges in daily life by reason of their ageing minds. My temporary goal is to examine a potential practical and scientific pathway for the community above to improve living conditions.

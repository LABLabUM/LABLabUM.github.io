research_interests:
- One of my current research interests is to figure out the accuracy and applicability of different language usage detection methods and develop some methods that can be widely used. Another one is about the relationship between bilinguals and mitigate cognitive function decline. Through this line of research, we aim to help researchers measure the language usage in a utility way and help the elderly against dementia.

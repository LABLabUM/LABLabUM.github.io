research_interests:
- I am currently doing my Master's degree in Centre for Cognitive and Brian Science, University of Macau. I completed my undergraduate education at School of Psychology, South China Normal University, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Psychology (Base Class) with honours. During the four-year undergraduate, I joined Professor Ruiming Wang's Lab and well cooperated with various lab members in doing studies in Psycholinguistics as well as other related areas. 
- My research interests mainly involve psycholinguistics, bilingualism and speech. Currently, I am particularly interested in how bilinguals process accent when listening to speech from a second language, which leads me to digging out the very essence of accent in our human brains. I’d like to consider behavioural experiments, neuroimaging methodologies (EEG/fMRI) as my main techniques, while I am also passionate about introducing Python into my researches and have done some scripts that helped with audio editing.
One of my current research interests is to figure out the accuracy and applicability of different language usage detection methods and develop some methods that can be widely used. Another one is about the relationship between bilinguals and mitigate cognitive function decline. Through this line of research, we aim to help researchers measure the language usage in a utility way and help the elderly against dementia.

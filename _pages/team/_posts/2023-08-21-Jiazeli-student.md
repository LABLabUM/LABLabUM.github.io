research_interests:
- I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Neuroscience at the University of Macau. My academic interests lie in the field of language cognition, with a particular focus on investigating ways to prevent cognitive decline in the elderly through language training. Alongside this, I am intrigued by the underlying consequence of bilinguals/multilinguals such as their executive control and cognitive flexibility. My research interests include Age-related cognitive functional decline, Bilingualism/ multilingualism, Second language acquisition.

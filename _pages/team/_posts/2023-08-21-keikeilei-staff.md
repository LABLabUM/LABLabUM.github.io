research_interests:
- My current focus is on Macau's older population, understanding their cognitive abilities and holistic well being. Partnering with associations, we're exploring ways to support Macau senior care. 
- One of my proudest accomplishments is bringing people together. I arrange meetings that connect researchers, clinicians, and various associations. It's all about finding common ground and working together to achieve a common goal.
- What motivates me even more is connecting different generations.
- It's not just about research; it's about building a community.

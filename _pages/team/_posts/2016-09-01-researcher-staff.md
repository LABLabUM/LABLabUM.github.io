research_interests:
- Cognitive abilities, such as executive function and language production, decline with age. Older adults typically struggle to memorize items, inhibit irrelevant information, and/or produce fluent speech. These age-associated declines interfere with older adults’ successful communication and social interactions. To help alleviate these problems, my research investigates factors that contribute to age-related declines in language production, and their neural bases, mainly from four perspectives, 1) Phonological characteristics, 2) Cognitive control demands, 3) Functional connectivity, and 4) Bilingualism. I use various behavioral and neuroscience methods to investigate my research questions, including Electroencephalography (EEG), and Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI).

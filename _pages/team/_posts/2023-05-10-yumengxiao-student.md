research_interests:
- Specifically, my work examines language use within bilingual and multilingual populations. My present research endeavors center on the development of an objective methodology for measuring the everyday language use of multilingual individuals. Ultimately, it is my hope to create an assessment tool that is tailored to the unique demographic characteristics of the Macau region.

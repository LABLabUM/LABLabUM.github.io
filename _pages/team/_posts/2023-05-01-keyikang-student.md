introduction:
- I’m a Ph.D. student in the Center of Cognitive and Brain Science & Department of Psychology at UM and a member of the LAB Lab. I received my bachelor’s and master’s degree in linguistics from Nankai University and Beijing Normal University. Language is one of the most advanced human cognitive functions, and I really expect to get a little closer to the truth of human language processing and language evolvement with age through my study.
- My research interests are mainly concerned with bilingualism and age-related decline of cognitive ability, including language processing, executive control capability, and so on. We focus on how bilingual/multilingual experiences affect our language ability and executive function, and how effective language training can help delay age-related decline in language and cognitive ability. We will explore these questions through behavioral experiments and neuroimaging techniques (EEG/fMRI).
